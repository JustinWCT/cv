        <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                My professional experience as a Senior Software Support Agent combines two of my greatest passions: customer service and technology. Helping people find solutions to their problems - no matter how big or small - is a truly fulfilling task for me. Being able to help people with something that I personally love is even better!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I manage enterprise/"prosumer" grade network hardware and a handful of Linux servers running almost entirely free and open source services for my household. Alongside those servers hosted on physical hardware, I have several cloud based servers running educational and practical projects on DigitalOcean "droplets" and AWS EC2 instances. To name a few: BigBlueButton, NextCloud with OnlyOffice, Grafana Monitoring with several self hosted custom data sources (MySQL, Loki with Promtail, Prometheus with InfluxDB and Telegraf).
                
                I have always been known as the "go-to computer guy" in my personal and professional life. In my current role, I am often the first point of contact for "Level 0" support before escalating to IT or outside support. I am currently working toward a career as a Software Engineer, hoping to specialize in software integrations and database management.
